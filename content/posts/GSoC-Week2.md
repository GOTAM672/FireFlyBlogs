<b>Project Title : Create a New “System” panel in GNOME Settings</b><br>
<b>Mentor : [Felipe Borges](https://gitlab.gnome.org/felipeborges)</b><br>
<b>Contributor : [Gotam Gorabh](https://gitlab.gnome.org/gautham_x)</b><br>


#### Introduction

Implementing `Remote Desktop` page will allow user to access and control a computer or a desktop environment remotely from another location.
It allows users to connect to a remote computer or server and interact with it as if they were physically present in front of it.

<b>This week I will implement only the GUI of the Remote Desktop Page.</b>

<b><i>Remote Desktop Mockup</i></b>

I will address this [Issue(#2241)](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center/-/issues/2241) and implement this [mockup](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Design/settings-mockups/-/blob/master/remote-desktop/remote-desktop.png) in this project. For more details here is my [Proposal](https://github.com/GOTAM672/GSoC-Gnome-Proposal).

#### Week 1 Goals:

- Add `remote_desktop_row` using `CcListRow` into empty system panel.
- Implement the content page for the `remote_desktop_row` using `AdwLeaflet`.
- Inside the content page Implement the GUI according to the `Remote Desktop` mockup.
- Take feedback from my mentors and design team members for any modification apart from mockups.
- Eliminate errors and wrong coding standards.

#### Progress Made:

- Added `remote_desktop_row` using `CcListRow` into empty system panel.

#### Deliverables:

To create a Remote Desktop page, I added three files name `cc-system-remote-page.c`, `cc-system-remote-page.h`, and `cc-system-remote-page.ui` inside `system` folder.
