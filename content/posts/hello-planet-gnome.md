#### Hey, Everyone! 

I'm Gotam Gorabh, a Computer Science & Engineering student at the Indian Institute of Information Technology Kottayam, India.
I want to thank GNOME and my mentor Felipe Borges for giving me the incredible opportunity to contribute to the GNOME Settings project.

#### About My GSoC Project

This summer I’ll be working on <b>Creating a New "System" panel into the GNOME Settings</b> under the mentorship of Felipe Borges. 

GNOME Settings (aka gnome-control-center) is a graphical user interface tool used in
GNOME-based Linux distribution for managing system settings and preferences. By Creating a new system panel will provide users with a unified interface for managing various settings. 

We can achieve it by merging Date & Time, Users, Region & Language, and About panels, and Implementing a Remote Desktop page into the system panel. 
It will provide a more streamlined and user-friendly experience for GNOME users.

The following tasks are to be done this summer...


- [ ] Add New Empty <b>System Panel</b> to Panel List (<b>week 1</b>)
- [ ] Add <b>Region & Language</b> Page into the System Panel (<b>week 2 & week 3</b>)
- [ ] Add <b>Date & Time</b> Page into the System Panel (<b>week 4 & week 5</b>)
- [ ] Add <b>About</b> Page into the System Panel (<b>week 6</b>)
- [ ] Add <b>Users</b> Page into the System Panel (<b>week 7, week 8 & week 9</b>)
- [ ] Add <b>Remote</b> Desktop Page into the System Panel (<b>week 10</b>)
- [ ] Discussion on adding the unit test cases and Eliminating errors (<b>week 11</b>)

#### More About Me and Experience With GNOME

I love to learn and try new stuff in my free time and I believe in learning by doing. My open-source contribution journey start in August 2022 with GNOME by fixing typos in GNOME Nautilus.
After that, I came so far by diving deeper into the other GNOME projects, exploring various areas, and expanding my contributions.

Each contribution taught me valuable lessons in software development, including writing clean code, following established coding standards, and effectively utilizing version control systems.


Through my journey with GNOME, I also discovered the significance of open-source communities as a whole. I witnessed the power of collaboration and the willingness of individuals worldwide to contribute their time and expertise for the greater good. This experience instilled in me a strong belief in the open source ethos and its potential to drive innovation and positive change.

As I continue on this journey, I am excited to explore new avenues for GNOME and other open-source projects. I look forward to further enhancing my skills, embracing new challenges, and making a positive difference in the open source community.

Thanks, GNOME!
