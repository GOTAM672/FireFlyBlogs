<b>Project Title : Create a New “System” panel in GNOME Settings</b><br>
<b>Mentor : [Felipe Borges](https://gitlab.gnome.org/felipeborges)</b><br>
<b>Contributor : [Gotam Gorabh](https://gitlab.gnome.org/gautham_x)</b><br>


#### Introduction

This summer I'm working on a project titled Create a New "System" panel in GNOME Settings, which aims to create a New System panel. This blog summarizes my progress during the bonding period and the first week of the Google Summer Of Code 2023.

I will address this [Issue(#2241)](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center/-/issues/2241) and implement this [mockup](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Design/settings-mockups/-/blob/master/system/system-panel.png) in this project. For more details here is my [Proposal](https://github.com/GOTAM672/GSoC-Gnome-Proposal).

#### Week 1 Goals:

- Add an empty system panel to the panel list of GNOME Settings.
- Eliminate errors and wrong coding standards.

#### Progress Made:

- Completed the setup of the development environment and configured the project structure.
- Gathered all the necessary documents that will help in this project such as <b>GObject, GTK</b>, etc.
- Took inspiration from other panels(especially the <b>Accessibility panel</b>) to implement a new system panel. 
- Successfully implemented a new empty system panel.

#### Deliverables:

To create a new system panel, I created a new folder name `system` inside `gnome-control-center/panels` folder.  
Below is the structure of the files and folders inside `system` folder  

![](structure.png)

- `gnome-system-panel.desktop.in` is a new desktop file for the system panel which needs to be installed into the system path to load the panel
- `org.gnome.Settings-gear-symbolic.svg` file provides a gear symbolic icon to the new system panel.

Also modified `gnome-control-center/panels/meson.build` , `gnome-control-center/shell/cc-panel-list.c` , and `gnome-control-center/shell/cc-panel-loader.c` files.  

#### Related Merge Request:

- `Create initial base structure for the new "System" panel` [!1800](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center/-/merge_requests/1800)
-  `Add title to system panel` [!1815](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center/-/merge_requests/1815)

#### Plan for the Next Week:

In the next week, I will add `Remote Desktop Panel` as a page into the new system panel. 

This week is not over yet, so stay tuned for more updates.
